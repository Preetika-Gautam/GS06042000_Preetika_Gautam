# Project README

## Instructions to Run and Test the Code

1. Upon launching the application, you will be directed to the landing page.
2. To proceed, log in using the following credentials:
   - **Login ID:** `admin`
   - **Password:** `admin@123`
3. After a successful login, you will be redirected to the dashboard page, which is the **Stores Screen**.

### Logout Option

- On the dashboard page, you will find the **Logout** option located on the top-right corner of the header. Clicking on this will log you out of the application.

## Key Features and Proficiencies Demonstrated

1. **UI Libraries Usage:**
   I have integrated UI libraries such as **MUI (Material UI)** for icons and **Tanstack Table** for table implementation. These libraries enhance the overall user experience by providing efficient and responsive components. **MUI** helps streamline UI development with pre-built components that follow Material Design guidelines, making the app both functional and aesthetically pleasing. **Tanstack Table** is an advanced and flexible table library, which I have used to manage and display complex data structures efficiently. This choice showcases my proficiency in utilizing modern libraries that improve development speed and maintainability.

2. **Planning Page Implementation:**
   Implementing the **Planning Page** was a challenging task due to the need for proper data mapping from the frontend. Without APIs or mock data objects, this process required me to manually structure and organize data, which could have been more efficient with access to pre-existing data endpoints. Despite this challenge, I successfully implemented the logic and layout, showcasing my problem-solving skills and ability to work with dynamic data sources.

## Areas for Improvement (If I Had 4 More Hours)

If I had an additional 4 hours to improve my solution, I would focus on the following areas:

1. **Backend Integration:**
   I would implement API endpoints or mock data objects to provide dynamic data to the frontend. This would have streamlined the process of data mapping, making the Planning page more efficient and allowing for real-time data updates.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   I would improve error handling for edge cases, such as invalid login attempts or missing data. This would ensure a smoother user experience by providing appropriate feedback for any issues that arise during the usage of the application.

3. **Optimized Performance:**
   I would focus on optimizing the application's performance, especially in terms of data rendering in large tables. By leveraging techniques such as lazy loading or pagination, I could enhance the scalability of the table component for larger datasets.

By making these improvements, I would further enhance the application's usability, scalability, and robustness.
